## Tutorial Linear Regression Basics

This tutorial details a simple regerssion analysis based on the Formaldehyde dataset.

### First, creating the dataset

This is done relying on the `DataFrames.jl` package.

```@example basic1
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(Carb=[0.1,0.3,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.9], OptDen=[0.086,0.269,0.446,0.538,0.626,0.782])
```

### Second, the model is defined
Here we want to have OptDen the dependent variable (the response) and Carb the independent variable (a predictor). Our model will have an intercept, however the intercept is implicitely added to the model. 
The model is defined as `Optden ~ Carb`, the variables needs to be column names from the DataFrame which is passed as the second argument to the `regress` function.
The `lm` object will then be displayed to present the most important information from the regression.

```@example basic1
using LinearRegression
using StatsModels # this is requested to use the @formula

lm = regress(@formula(OptDen ~ Carb), df)
```

### Third, some illustration about the model is created
Here we will only look at the fit-plot. To do so we only need to add a third argument to the `regress` function. Namely the name of the plot requested ("fit"). When at least a plot is requested the `regress` function will return a pair of object: the information about the regression (as before), and an object (`Dict`) to access the requested plot(s).

```@example basic1
using VegaLite # this is the package use for plotting

lm, ps = regress(@formula(OptDen ~ Carb), df, "fit")
ps["fit"]
```

The response is plotted on the y-axis, and the predictor is plotted on the x-axis.
The dark orange line represents the regression equation. The dark grey band represents the confidence interval given the Î± (which defaults to 0.05 and hence gives a 95% confidence interval). The light grey band represent the individual prediction interval. The blue circle represents the actual observation from the dataset.

#### Fourth, generate the predictions from the model
Here we get the predicted values from the model using the same Dataframe.
```@example basic1
results = predict_in_sample(lm, df)
```
#### Fifth, generate the others statistics about the model
In order to get all the statistics, one can use the "all" keyword.

```@example basic1
results = predict_in_sample(lm, df, req_stats="all")
```

#### Sixth, generate prediction for new data
We first create a new DataFrame which need to use the same column names as the ones that were used in the model. In our case there is only one column "Carb".

```@example basic1
ndf = DataFrame(Carb= [0.11, 0.22, 0.55, 0.77])
predictions = predict_out_of_sample(lm, ndf)
```
